i don't collect any sort of data.
The scores are saved in the app's private folder on the device, THay can be safetly deleted through the settings and they are never shared with anyone, not even with me.
The ads are managed by "Google AdMob", i do not have control over the user's data and i have blocked most, if not all, tracking options
